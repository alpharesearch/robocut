ROBOCUT
^^^^^^^

Robocut is a simple graphical program to allow you to cut graphics with a Graphtec Craft Robo 2 Vinyl Cutter model
CC220-20 and Sihouette SD.

It can read SVG files produced by Inkscape, but it should also work with other SVG files.
Unlike the official programs, Robocut can run on Linux and probably Mac OS X with a tiny bit of work.
It may work with the newer CC330-20 model if the USB IDs are changed, but I donâ€™t have one to test with.
